<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->



## About The Project

Six Hitmarkers is a mod for the game DayZ (https://www.bohemia.net/games/dayz) that adds hitmarkers to modded servers. Server owners have the ability to customize the hitmarkers, including enabling or disabling them for different entities such as animals, zombies, players, and Expansion helicopters. Players also have the option to enable or disable hitmarkers for their own game by pressing a keybind. By default, critical hits (e.g. brain or headshot) on zombies and animals will trigger hitmarkers, but this will be configurable in a future update.
